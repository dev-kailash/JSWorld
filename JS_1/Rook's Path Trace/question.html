                <p>Your task is to <strong>write a JS program that traces the path of Rook from the checkbox that is
                        clicked by the user.</strong><br><br>You are provided with Boilerplate HTML and CSS code, that
                    builds a chessboard on the page.<br><br>The HTML has majorly 3 types of components in the following
                    inheritance:<br><strong>div.board &gt; div.row &gt;
                        div.checkbox</strong><br><br>Here,<br><br><strong>1. div.board:</strong><br>1.1. contains the
                    entire chessboard<br>1.2. has 8 div.row as immediate children<br><br><strong>2.
                        div.row:</strong><br>2.1. contains a single horizontal row in the chessboard<br>2.2. there are a
                    total of 8 div.row<br>2.3. each div.row contains 8 div.checkbox<br><br><strong>3.
                        div.checkbox:</strong><br>3.1. depicts a single checkbox in the board<br>3.2. there are a total
                    of 64 div.checkbox in the board<br>3.3. each checkbox has a defined style.backgroundColor of white
                    or black<br><br><strong>Your task is to:</strong><br>1. Trace the path of Rook from any checkbox
                    that is clicked by the user.<br>2. Look at the below example to understand the path of a Rook
                    (horizontal and vertical).<br>3. Tracing the path means to set the background color property as
                    'red' for all the checkboxes on the path.<br><br></p>
                <p><img src="rook-trace.jpg" alt="board" width="443" height="446" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></p>
                <p><br><strong>Note:</strong><br>Additionally, as a bonus, you can also try to refresh the board if the
                    user clicks on some other checkbox, and then trace the path from the new checkbox. (Code for this is
                    provided in the solution)<br><br>Write the solution program in script.js file.<br><br>Don't make any
                    changes to the boilerplate code.</p>
