                    <p>Your task is to write a JS program that <strong>traces the path of Bishop from the checkbox that
                            is clicked by the user.</strong><br><br>You are provided with Boilerplate HTML and CSS code,
                        that builds a chessboard on the page.<br><br>The HTML has majorly 3 types of components in the
                        following inheritance: <br><strong>div.board &gt; div.row &gt;
                            div.checkbox</strong><br><br>Here,<br><br><strong>1. div.board:</strong><br> 1.1. contains
                        the entire chessboard<br> 1.2. has 8 div.row as immediate children<br><br><strong>2.
                            div.row:</strong><br> 2.1. contains a single horizontal row in the chessboard<br> 2.2. there
                        are a total of 8 div.row <br> 2.3. each div.row contains 8 div.checkbox<br><br><strong>3.
                            div.checkbox:</strong><br> 3.1. depicts a single checkbox in the board<br> 3.2. there are a
                        total of 64 div.checkbox in the board<br> 3.3. each checkbox has a defined style.backgroundColor
                        of white or black<br><br><strong>Your task is to:</strong><br>1. Trace the path of Bishop from
                        any checkbox that is clicked by user.<br>2. Look at the below example to understand the path of
                        a Bishop (cross diagonals).<br>3. Tracing the path means to set the background color property as
                        'red' for all the checkboxes on the path.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="./bishop-trace.jpg" alt="board" width="447" height="447"
                            style="cursor: zoom-in;"></p>
                    <p><br><strong>Note: </strong><br>Additionally as a bonus, you can also try to refresh the board if
                        the user clicks on some other checkbox, and then trace the path from the new checkbox. (Code for
                        this is provided in the solution)</p>
                    <p>Write the solution program in script.js file.</p>
                    <p>Don't make any changes to the boilerplate code.</p>
